Here are placed `widget` declarations (1) including roots for pages (2).

(1) Note that it's a folder of only declarations, so they are not necessary to be in use (but they may depend on each other).

(2) See `/pages` folder to declare the root for a page. (by root I mean a widget that will be passed to the `page` argument of `GetPage`)

- Widgets can depend on controllers
